#  ReCell – ML-Based Dynamic Pricing Model for Used Devices

This project aims to help **ReCell**, a startup in the refurbished electronics market, build a **data-driven pricing model** to predict the resale value of used smartphones and tablets using **Linear Regression**.

---

## Project Overview

The used and refurbished smartphone market is growing rapidly. To stay competitive, ReCell needs a **dynamic pricing solution** that determines the fair market value of pre-owned devices.

This project explores various device attributes — such as **brand**, **storage**, **RAM**, and **condition** — to predict the resale price and identify key price-driving factors.

##  Objectives

- Analyze the dataset through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Perform **data cleaning** and **feature engineering**
- Build and train a **Linear Regression model**
- Validate all **Linear Regression assumptions**:
  - Linearity
  - Independence
  - Multicollinearity (using VIF)
  - Normality of residuals
  - Homoscedasticity
- Evaluate model using **R²** and **RMSE**
- Interpret insights and key predictors influencing price

---

##  Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Model:** Linear Regression  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook  

---

##  Key Findings

- Brand and storage capacity are the strongest predictors of resale price.  
- Devices in better physical condition maintain significantly higher resale value.  
- The model achieved strong interpretability after validating assumptions and removing multicollinearity.  

---

##  Results

- Achieved reliable regression performance with meaningful insights for **dynamic pricing strategy**.  
- Model interpretability helps ReCell make data-driven business decisions.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Data Cleaning & EDA  
- Linear Regression Modeling  
- Statistical Assumption Testing  
- Model Evaluation (R², RMSE)  
- Feature Importance Analysis  
- Visualization & Interpretation
