#  INN Hotels ‚Äì Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction

This project focuses on predicting **hotel booking cancellations** for INN Hotels using **machine learning classification models**. The goal is to help hotel management optimize occupancy rates and revenue by identifying bookings likely to be canceled.

---

##  Project Overview

INN Hotels faces challenges with last-minute cancellations that impact room allocation and revenue. This project leverages data analytics and machine learning to forecast cancellation probability based on customer and booking attributes.

---

##  Objectives

- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand patterns and trends in booking data  
- Clean, preprocess, and engineer relevant features  
- Build and compare multiple **classification models** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- Evaluate models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
- Identify key factors influencing cancellations to support business decision-making  

---

## üß© Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook  

---

##  Key Insights

- Customer type, deposit type, and lead time were the most significant predictors of cancellation.  
- Logistic Regression and Random Forest models achieved up to **86% accuracy** and **0.82 F1-score**.  
- Early detection of high-risk bookings can improve occupancy management and reduce revenue leakage.
